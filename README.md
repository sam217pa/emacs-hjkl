`hjkl` provides an easy way to navigate source files using context dependent
keybindings, _ie_ keybindings that trigger an action depending on characters
that follow or precede the point (cursor). The idea is to move swiftly by
semantically relevant units in a language agnostic way. You use `hjkl-up`,
`hjkl-down` and other keybindings to the previous or next semantic unit (a
sexp, a paragraph for example) when point is after or behind a regular
expression.

In a way, `hjkl` was born as the result of my frustration not being able to
use [lispy](https://github.com/abo-abo/lispy) keybindings in all major modes.

### Usage


The following code tells emacs to jump to the next sentence when the cursor
is positioned after a period, an exclamation or question mark, or to jump to
the next outline heading if the cursor is before the value of
`outline-regexp`, when the key defined by hjkl-down is pressed. Otherwise the
key calling hjkl-down acts normally.

```elisp
(hjkl-define-keys
 '((:keymap text-mode-map
    :bind (:down (("\\.\\|?\\|!" #'forward-sentence back)
                  (outline-regexp #'outline-next-heading))))))
```

It results into the evaluation of the following snippet:

```elisp
(define-key text-mode-map hjkl-down
  (lambda () (interactive)
    (cond ((looking-back "\\.\\|?\\|!")
           (funcall #'forward-sentence))
          ((looking-at outline-regexp)
           (outline-next-heading))
          (t (self-insert-command 1)))))
```

### hjkl Directions


`hjkl` provides several keybindings by default, corresponding to
`hjkl-directions`:


- `:up`: useful to goes up a semantic unit. It can be used to jump to the
   beginning of the previous paragraph, SEXP or outline-heading.

- `:down`: it makes sense to bind function that does the opposite of those
   bound to `hjkl-up`.

- `:left` and `:right`: useful to goes out of a semantic unit. It can be used
   to jump to the enclosing parent delimiter when the cursor is before a
   closing delimiter, or to hide the body of the current outline heading.

- `:jump`: useful to jump to a specific location using
   [avy](https://github.com/abo-abo/avy) for example.

- `:eval`: used to evaluate SEXP or expression in a REPL. It is useful in
   emacs-lisp, ESS-modes, python and languages that interact with a REPL.

- `:mark`: used to mark expressions, paragraph and stuff like that.


### Function Documentation


#### `(hjkl-define-keys KEY-DEFINITION)`

Call ‘hjkl--define-key’ on each sublist of KEY-DEFINITION.

KEY-DEFINITION should be a list of the form

	’((:keymap KEYMAP
   	   :bind (:DIRECTION ((RE FUNCTION-CALL BACK)))))

:keymap should be a valid emacs keymap.

:bind is mandatory, it corresponds to the list of condition to
check for each hjkl direction.

RE is a valid regular expression, passed to ‘looking-at’ if BACK
is nil (the default) or ‘looking-back’ if BACK is t.

FUNCTION-CALL can be a simple function call of the form
#’function or a lambda expression.

An example usage would be the following snippet:

	(hjkl-define-keys
	 ’((:keymap text-mode-map
	    :bind (:up (("\.\|?\|!" (lambda ()
	                                   (backward-sentence)
	                                   (backward-char 1))
	                 back))
	           :down (("\.\|?\|!" #’forward-sentence back))))))

It bind ‘hjkl-up’ to jump to the beginning of the previous
sentence when the cursor is after a ‘.‘, a ‘?‘ or a ‘!‘ and
‘hjkl-down’ to go the next sentence. The "back" mention is
optional but indicate that the characters that matters precedes
the cursor.


#### `(hjkl-update-keys)`

Update keybinding definition if ‘‘hjkl-bindings’’ is defined
by calling ‘‘hjkl-define-keys’’ on it.
